# THIS IS DUTCH FREEWARE (FREE TO USE BUT LOCKED)
This is a warehouse management system in excel (DUTCH ONLY!)

If you want to use it feel free, macro's are hidden behind a lock. 
But if you want to translate, or have a good proposal to change code, feel free to contact.

"Magazijn 2" supports Multiple Scanners, (V1 is outdated and unsupported)

[MB] = For Multiple Barcodes support (so can be skiped).

--------
# Install
> 1) [MB] Install 'LuaMacros' (or unzip the LuaMacros.zip).
> 2) [optional] Install 'code128.ttf' (barcode font) to use the generate barcodes in excel. else these will look like random characters

You should now be able to start with **"Startup"**.

--------
# Startup
> 1) [MB] Execute 'MultibleScannersHandler.lua' with the installed '//LuaMacros/LuaMacros.exe'.
> 2) [MB] Press the blue play button at the left-ish top on the screen.
> 3) [MB] **If** needed to manually set barcode scanners ID each time (Prompt; "Press a key to indentify device Scanner#"); **Then** do 4 + 5
> 4) [MB] [opt] Open notepad or something else to type in **so you wont type in this LUA script!!!** ALSO DO NOT USE YOUR KEYBOARD, OR THIS WILL BE SET AS SCANNER1.
> 5) [MB] [opt] Scan something with the scanner (This will bound that scanner to the ID).
> 6) [MB] Check for errors (EXAMPLE: [LUA] ERROR: Device with name Scanner1 not found) see **"On error"**.
> 7) Open the Excel file "Magazijn 2.xlsm".	(Magazijn.xlsm was the old one and unsupported, single scanner only)
> 8) Enable the macro's, you should see a pop-up about who made this program if it worked.

You should now be able to start with **"Scanning"**.

--------	
# Scanning
[MB] The PC can't handle multiple inputs at the exact same time, Let a gap of at least **0.5 seconds between each input/scan**

[MB] Each scanner will remember it's own UserID, so both scanners ban be used separately (Each barcode has a prefix '0b' or '1b' done by 'MultibleScannersHandler.lua')

Borrow
> 1) Scan the UserID.
> 2) Scan all ItemID(s) that you want to lend to this person.

Hand-In
> 1) Scan the UserID.
> 2) The 'UserHas' will be filled with all stuff the user has, click on it to start handing the items in (Direct Hand-In is without prompt or such! so be careful). SideNote: Do not scan stuff while doing this, this also count as an input.

# On error

Click in the sheet 'Momenteel uitgeleend' on the UserID, UserName, ItemID or ItemName to sort. **This will only sort the data that is currently on this list (so no data that isn't shown because of the cell limits)** (sorting also works in the 'DB' sheet)
